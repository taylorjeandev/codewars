// Today's challenge is minor to give you all a bit of a break halfway through the challenge week, but there are a couple of side quests I'm going to throw out for those with extra time on their hands.

// So far we've swapped out calculator characters, cleaned up after a cat and a preschooler, and placed some spaces. Today is simple! Given a string, reverse it. Any details like whitespace, letter casing, or punctuation should be preserved and flipped along with the rest of the string. For example:



// "   The white space at the beginning of this string doesn't match the whitespace at the end. "
// reverse it
// " .dne eht ta ecapsetihw eht hctam t'nseod gnirts siht fo gninnigeb eht ta ecaps etihw ehT   "

function reverseString(str) {
    console.log(str.split("").reverse().join(""));
}
