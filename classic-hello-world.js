// You are given a method called main, make it print the line Hello World!, (yes, that includes a new line character at the end) and don't return anything

// Note that for some languages, the function main is the entry point of the program.

// Here's how it will be tested:

class Solution{
    static main() {
      console.log("Hello World!");
    }  
}

// Test.expect(logRecord.indexOf("Hello World!") !== -1);
